# Interview Preparation Guide (work in progress ðŸš§)

## 1. Behavioral Interview ðŸ§ 
### 1.1 The _tell me about yourself_ question
This question is the ice breaker in job interviews, interviewers often use it as an opportunity for you to tell your story (and relax a bit before the real interview).

Even then, you don't want to miss the chance to use this short introduction for showcasing your strenghts and interest.

**What they want to know**
- **Who you are professionally** -  your background, skills, and career path.
- **Why you are here** - what led you to interview for the role and company.
- **What you bring to the table** - how your experience aligns with their needs.

**How to structure your answer**

Use the present-past-future framework:
- **Present**: Start with your current role or what youâ€™re doing now.
- **Past**: Briefly walk through relevant past experiences and accomplishments.
- **Future**: End with what youâ€™re looking for next.

**Tips**
- Keep it short and relevant, around 2-3 minutes is often a sweet spot.
- Don't go to personal, focus on your professional story.
- **Summarize** your resume, don't recite it from memory.
